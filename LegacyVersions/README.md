# Legacy JSBridge Version

This folder contains older versions of JSBridge with fixed iOS 13 identification.
It can be used by organizations with older Offline HTML solution having problems on these devices.
Despite we recommend upgrading your JSBridge.js script to the latest version, these scripts can be used to fix the issue with minimal change to the source code.

JSBridge v10.1 and newer is not affected by this issue and it identifies iOS 13 devices correctly.
